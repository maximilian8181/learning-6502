# learning-6502
This repository was created to house the source code of a bunch of programs I wrote while learning 6502 assembly.

## Why did I start to learn 6502 assembly?
I've always been interested in programming games for older consoles like the NES or the Atari 2600, and also having an interest in low-level development as a whole. The CS curriculum of the college I went to didn't cover any assembly, making me in the process more curious about the subject. 

The programs in this repository represent my efforts to get accustomed to writing software in assembly language. I hope to be capable enough in the near future to tackle the task of building games or cool demos for retro consoles without much trouble!

## How to run the programs
All programs in this space will run on the 6502 JS Simulator.
